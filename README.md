This is a Meteor app put together to help the NMC team choose places to eat lunch in Carborro/Chapel Hill. Thanks to Meteor, voting is in realtime and a counter is show to indicate how many people are currently looking at the page.

The [Konami code](http://snaptortoise.com/konami-js/) resets the counts.

An example is up at [wheretheheckshouldweeattoday.meteor.com](http://wheretheheckshouldweeattoday.meteor.com).
